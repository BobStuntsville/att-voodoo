# ✨ Casting spells

Casting spells requires your patience and resources.

First, to **invoke** a spell you must be near a **Spellcrafting Conduit**, speak a series of incantations and offer an array of different material components to be destroyed in the process.

Depending on the type of the spell, a successful **invocation** may either **cast** that spell immediately or **prepare** it in your mind with a fast trigger for casting later.

## Instant spells

Instant spells are cast **immediately** after successfully invoking them. Most utility spells—such as spells from the _transmutation_ and _conjuration_ schools—are instant spells.

Instant spells do not require an available spell preparation slot.

## Prepared spells

Prepared spells are **stored** in a spell preparation slot after successfully invoking them. Most combat spells are prepared spells. You must prepare these spells near a **Spellcrafting Conduit**, but once prepared, you may go anywhere and cast it by speaking the spell's fast trigger phrase.

Currently, everyone has 10 spell preparation slots. When you prepare an 11th spell, you lose the oldest prepared spell.

## Spellcrafting Conduits

Voodoo magic is very strong near emerald beryl, which are green crystals found in large cluster formations deep in the mines. Emerald beryl acts as a conduit for invoking Voodoo spells, and you must be near one of these clusters to access its power and invoke spells.

Some towns have hauled these crystals from the mines and erected **Spellcrafting Conduits** around town for easier access to Voodoo magic.

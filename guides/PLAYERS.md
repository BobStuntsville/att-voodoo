# üïπÔ∏è Guide for players

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release of `Voodoo Setup.exe`](https://github.com/mdingena/att-voodoo/releases).
1. Run `Voodoo Setup.exe`. This is a one-click installation, so after the installation process finishes, you should have a new desktop icon for Voodoo.

## Usage

1. Launch `Voodoo`.
1. Sign in with your Alta account. This opens a new window in your browser. Confirm that you are really on the official Alta website before entering your credentials, otherwise please [report an issue](https://github.com/mdingena/att-voodoo/issues).
1. Voodoo will create a new play session for you, and automatically continue to the server selection screen.
1. On the server selection screen you can see all ATT game servers that support Voodoo. Join one of these servers in-game.
1. Voodoo automatically detects if you have joined a supported server and will display the spellcasting interface.
1. Use the [spellbook](../spellbook/README.md) to learn which spells to cast.

## Some spells have not been discovered yet!

This means you must experiment with verbal and material spell components until you discover a spell. Whether you share what you find with others is up to you. The first person to publicly share their discovery of a new spell will be credited with the discovery.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Your items are at risk!

Voodoo is designed to consume items in your belt. You use your belt to hold the spell's material components as you speak your incantations. With each incantation, a material component is removed from the belt dock corresponding to your incantation glyph (left-to-right). For example, the first incantation will consume the item that is in your left-most belt dock. **Weapons can be targets of incantations!** Be careful, magic is powerful ;-)

## Spellcasting example

In the [spellbook](../spellbook/README.md) you can find the incantations for discovered spells. The incantations are made up of verbal and material components.

- The verbal component is what you must **speak**.
- The material component is what you must **have in your belt**.

Your belt docks correspond to the incantation glyphs, which are as follows:

- `Œ∂` is your first incantation; it consumes items from your left-most belt dock.
- `Œ¥` is your second incantation; it consumes items from your second-from-the-left belt dock.
- `Œª` is your third incantation; it consumes items from your third-from-the-left belt dock.
- `Œ©` is your fourth incantation; it consumes items from your right-most belt dock.

Voodoo lends its power from emerald beryl, which are green crystal formations commonly found in the mines. Some towns have erected **Spellcrafting Conduits** around town, which you can recognise by these green crystals. **You must stand close to these crystals to be able to tap into Voodoo magic!**

To cast **Craft Flask**:

1. Stand close to a **Spellcrafting Conduit**.
1. Put one sandstone in `Œ∂`.
1. Put one coal in `Œ¥`.
1. Awaken Voodoo (to make it listen to your voice commands) by speaking `"Awaken Voodoo"`.
1. Attune to the Spellcrafting Conduit (to tell Voodoo you're going to speak incantations) by speaking `"Attune Voodoo"`.
1. Speak `"essence of silica"`. This will consume the sandstone.
1. Speak `"heart of embers"`. This will consume the coal.
1. Speak `"seal"` to seal your incantation. You will not speak a third or fourth incantation for **Craft Flask**.
1. Voodoo will try to match your incantations to the spells it knows. It will find **Craft Flask**, which it will cast in your right hand.
1. Don't forget to grip it before you drop it on the floor ;-)
